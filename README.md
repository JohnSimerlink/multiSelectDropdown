# Group Multi Select

I needed a multi-select dropdown with the below features, and couldn't find anything that was exactly what I wanted, so I wrote this little library.

# Features
- [] clicking on the title/label on the menu reveals all the options of the menu, but no options are revealed before clicking
- [] clicking on a group name selects all of the options under the group name
- [] ability to pass in custom classes

## TODO
- [] index.html that has a test list with data-label element, and that imports the library first from a statically written js file and css file
- [] get index.html importing from webpack-dev-server live or from the compiled file in /dist
- [] transition to use SASS/LESS
- [] transition to use HAML
- [] package up into an npm package
